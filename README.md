# 04_GBS_pipeline

To run the Tassel GBS v2 pipeline with three filters (Inbreeding coefficient, Fisher exact test and Chi-square test), the tassel_pipeline.sh script should be modified to input FASTQ, key file and software. All other scripts should be in the same folder where tassel_pipeline.sh is present.
